				<p>Their cake was delicious! We went an untraditional route and we were not disappointed!<br> Yes, we got the traditional 4-tier cake, but we went with chocolate and guava filling.<br> Our guests loved it! Their service was amazing and super easy!<br> Can’t wait to order future special occasion cakes from them!</p><br>

				<<p>I recently ordered a birthday cake for my father’s 80th birthday.<br> I did a semi-custom cake and it turned out great! The cake was so moist, fluffy and not overly sweet.<br> It was a simple design but went well with the cake topper I had bought! I would definitely order a cake here again!</p>><br>
